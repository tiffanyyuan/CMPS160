	<p>There are two different sets of files in the submission folder.  The first set is for all the reqirements up until lab4.  In this program, a SOR is created from an arbitrarily drawn polyline.  The user will see a rubberband line when drawing the polyline.  This SOR is first rendered with flat shading and diffuse lighting.  SOR objects can be transformed, rotated, or scaled using mouse buttons.  SORs can also be saved as obj files using they "save" button, which allows them to be loaded onto the canvas again.  The loaded SORs will be drawn in diffuse shading in different colors(red, green, blue, purple, etc) to tell them apart.  The polyline SOR can be viewed with diffuse shading or smooth shading.  Specular lighting levels can be altered using the glossiness slider at the bottom.  Lighting can also be adjusted by clicking the line that goes from (0,0,0) to (500, 500, 500) or clicking the cube at the top.  When picked, an SOR will turn gray.  The user can then scale, translate, and rotate the SOR.  When nothing is picked, there will be no color changes and the user can adjust the camera.  The user can zoom in and out in perspective view, pan the camera in both perspective and orthographic views, and move the camera along the z-axis in both perspective and orthographic views.  The panning was done by translating the mvpMatrix.  Zooming and Z-camera movement were done setting the parameters of the orthographic/perspective views accordingly.

	<p>In the second set, a SOR is also created form an arbitrarily drawn polyline, and the user will once again see a rubberband line when drawing the polyline.  But this time the SOR has a texture image (sky.png) mapped to it.  The user can toggle between orthographic and perspective views.  
	</p>

	<p>User instructions:  You must first draw a polyline to generate a SOR.  Then load other SORs as obj files onto the canvas.  To move the camera along the z axis, you must hold down the middle button and move the mouse around.  I was not able to get the program to scroll after pressing the middle button.  Please also zoom in/out the camera before selecting and deselecting any SORs.  This also applies to scaling SORs so please scale first before deselecting anything.  
	</p>
	<p>These two set of files will only work for certain web browsers.  The set of files for the texture SOR (driverTexture.html, p4.js, and sky.png) only work with the Firefox browser.  The set of files with all the requirements up to lab 4 (driverLab4 and lab4.js) only work with Google Chrome browser.
